# Lung Nodule Detection Based On CT Scans
## Steps to run the code:
1. Extract subset0.zip file
2. Run mask.ipynb with annotations.csv and subset0.zip file by creating a output_final folder
3. Run the ROI.ipynb and then create a prepared_data folder 
4. Run images.ipynb to convert npy files to iamge files (.png files)
5. Finally, Run the lungnoduleunet.ipynb file to train and test the model.
6. The output_final and prepared_data folders can be found in the datasource folder
